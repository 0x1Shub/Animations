### About Animations

3. Create a new folder in relevant directory, with appropriate and unique name to best describe your animation (refrain from using generic names)

## Style Guidelines

When creating pull requests, please make sure that the commit message is concise but _specific_. That way, community members can benefit from the short, concrete descriptions that they can refer back to later, if needed.
